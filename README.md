# Polyphenols

#### Analysis of the Phenol-Explorer data and of polyphenol metabolite profiles in biofluids

Polyphenols are a large family of plant secondary metabolites that are consumed in large quantities daily from human diets. Many are bioactive, and it is thought that consumption protects against chronic disease and improves general wellbeing. Polyphenolic compounds are thought to be partly responsible for the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables.

This repository contains code for three projects on polyphenols. The first two are analyses of two different parts of the Phenol-Explorer database, which was first conceived in 2004 and remains a widely-used and valuable resource. The objective of the database was to store information on polyphenol content of food, the effect of processing and cooking on polyphenol content and polyphenol metabolism. The scripts stored here are the code base for a) analysis of metabolism data (1) and b) analysis of retention factor data (processing and cooking) (2).

The third project is the analysis of polyphenol metabolite measurements in blood and urine in cohort studies. At the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a method was developed to simultaneously analyse a set of diverse polyphenols in biofluids (3). Code for the analysis of polyphenol profiles in the EPIC cohort is stored in this repository.
